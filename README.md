### Requirements

 * Installed [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/) with tools

### Set up

#### CLI way

Fork this project at Github and add this repository as upstream.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_githubuser>/taskwarrior-androidapp.git
$ cd taskwarrior-androidapp
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/svijee/taskwarrior-androidapp
$ git fetch remote
$ git checkout -b remotes/upstream/master
$ git checkout -b my_feature_branch
```

Start the android GUI and download API 15 as our target.

```bash
$ android
```

Generate ant build files and more, API 15 is assumed to be target 1 (list with $(android list targets)). Make sure to not commit these generate files.

```bash
$ android update project --path taskwarrior-androidapp/ --target 1
$ android update project --path android-menudrawer/ --target 1
```

Create a virtual device (if you don't want to develop directly for you phone).

```bash
$ android create avd -n taskwarrior_emu -t 1
$ emulator -avd taskwarrior_emu &
```

Make your awesome changes and compile, install, and watch log outputs.
```bash
$ ant debug
$ ant installd # or $ adb -d install -r bin/TasksActivity-debug.apk
$ adb lolcat
```

When everything works make sure that your branch looks good, no generate files are committed and then make a pull request back here.
